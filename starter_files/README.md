# Operationalizing Machine Leargning Project - Udacity

This project entails a comprehensive machine learning endeavor within the Microsoft Azure framework. I established a cloud-based production model for machine learning, successfully deploying and utilizing it. Employing the Bank Marketing Dataset, I trained a machine learning model by harnessing the advanced AutoML capabilities of Azure Machine Learning Studio. The next step involved deploying this model to a production environment through Azure Container Instance (ACI), subsequently accessing it via REST endpoints. Moreover, I engineered, made accessible, and employed a streamlined pipeline to automate the entire sequence of actions.
